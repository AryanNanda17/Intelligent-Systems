    "# NumPy VS Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy:\n",
    "1. Core Functionality: NumPy is primarily used for numerical computing and working with large arrays and matrices.\n",
    "2. Data Structure: It provides the ndarray (N-dimensional array), which allows fast, vectorized operations on homogeneous data (all elements of the array are of the same type).\n",
    "3. Use Case: Ideal for performing mathematical, logical, and statistical operations on large datasets, especially when working with numerical data.\n",
    "4. Speed: NumPy arrays are more memory efficient and faster for numerical operations compared to Python lists.\n",
    "- Pandas:\n",
    "1. Core Functionality: Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is designed for working with labeled, heterogeneous data, particularly structured data like tables (think spreadsheets or SQL tables).\n",
    "2. Data Structures: It provides two primary data structures: Series (1-dimensional labeled array) and DataFrame (2-dimensional labeled data structure). These structures allow handling and analyzing data with various data types (numeric, string, etc.).\n",
    "3. Use Case: Excellent for data manipulation, cleaning, merging, reshaping, and handling missing values. It also offers high-level functionality for time series analysis.\n",
    "4. Flexibility: Pandas is better suited for working with real-world data that may involve heterogeneous data types (e.g., numbers, text, dates), and it has more advanced indexing and selection capabilities."

    "## Importing Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Pandas in your Python program, the standard way is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Explanation:\n",
    "- import pandas: This loads the Pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis, especially with structured data like tables.\n",
    "- as pd: This creates an alias (pd) for Pandas, allowing you to use pd instead of pandas throughout your code, making it more concise.\n"
